  pages = {054905},
  abstract = {We introduce the concepts of participant triangularity and triangular
	flow in heavy-ion collisions, analogous to the definitions of participant
	eccentricity and elliptic flow. The participant triangularity characterizes
	the triangular anisotropy of the initial nuclear overlap geometry
	and arises from event-by-event fluctuations in the participant-nucleon
	collision points. In studies using a multi-phase transport model
	(AMPT), a triangular flow signal is observed that is proportional
	to the participant triangularity and corresponds to a large third
	Fourier coefficient in two-particle azimuthal correlation functions.
	Using two-particle azimuthal correlations at large pseudorapidity
	separations measured by the PHOBOS and STAR experiments, we show
	that this Fourier component is also present in data. Ratios of the
	second and third Fourier coefficients in data exhibit similar trends
	as a function of centrality and transverse momentum as in AMPT calculations.
	These findings suggest a significant contribution of triangular flow
	to the ridge and broad away-side features observed in data. Triangular
	flow provides a new handle on the initial collision geometry and
	collective expansion dynamics in heavy-ion collisions.},

	of p_T and the transverse energy (SumE_T) summed over 3.1 < eta <
	4.9 in the direction of the Pb beam. The correlation function, constructed
	from charged particles, exhibits a long-range (2<|Delta-eta|<5) near-side
	(Delta-phi ~ 0) correlation that grows rapidly with increasing SumE_T.
	A long-range away-side (Delta-phi ~ pi) correlation, obtained by
	subtracting the expected contributions from recoiling dijets and
	other sources estimated using events with small SumE_T, is found
	to match the near-side correlation in magnitude, shape (in Delta-eta
	and Delta-phi) and SumE_T dependence. The resultant Delta-phi correlation
	is approximately symmetric about pi/2, and is consistent with a cos(2Delta-phi)
	modulation for all SumE_T ranges and particle p_T. The amplitude
	of this modulation is comparable in magnitude and p_T dependence

	in nuclear collisions at high energies in which coherent parton branching
	plays a central role. This picture is based on the appearance of
	a dynamically generated scale, the jet resolution scale, which controls
	the transverse resolution power of the medium to simultaneously propagating
	color probes. Since from the point of view of the medium all partonic
	jet fragments within this transverse distance act coherently as a
	single emitter, this scale allows us to rearrange the jet shower
	into effective emitters. We observe that in the kinematic regime
	of the LHC, the corresponding characteristic angle is comparable
	to the typical opening angle of high energy jets such that most of
	the jet energy is contained within a non-resolvable color coherent
	inner core. Thus, a sizable fraction of the jets are unresolved,
	losing energy as a single parton without modifications of their intra-jet
	structure. This new picture provides a consistent understanding of
	the present data on reconstructed jet observables and constitute
	the basis for future developments.},

  abstract = {Results on two-particle angular correlations for charged particles
	emitted in pPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy
	of 5.02 TeV are presented. The analysis uses two million collisions
	collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The correlations are
	studied over a broad range of pseudorapidity, η, and full azimuth,
	ϕ, as a function of charged particle multiplicity and particle transverse
	momentum, pT. In high-multiplicity events, a long-range (2<|Δη|<4),
	near-side (Δϕ≈0) structure emerges in the two-particle Δη-Δϕ correlation
	functions. This is the first observation of such correlations in
	proton-nucleus collisions, resembling the ridge-like correlations
	seen in high-multiplicity pp collisions at s=7 TeV and in AA collisions
	over a broad range of center-of-mass energies. The correlation strength
	exhibits a pronounced maximum in the range of pT=1-1.5 GeV/c and
	an approximately linear increase with charged particle multiplicity
	for high-multiplicity events. These observations are qualitatively
	similar to those in pp collisions when selecting the same observed
	particle multiplicity, while the overall strength of the correlations
	is significantly larger in pPb collisions.},

  abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion
	detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction
	sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics
	of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme
	values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions.
	Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions
	with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus
	runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC
	energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and
	to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to
	the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration
	including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes
	in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16 × 16 × 26 m 3 with
	a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists
	of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology
	choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements
	and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent
	design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity
	anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems
	were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent
	Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up
	to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow
	for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons
	produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems
	are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008
	when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception
	of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation
	Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors
	will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010.

	di-hadron proton- proton (p+p) data from the CMS experiment are in
	excellent agreement with computations in the Color Glass Condensate
	(CGC) Effective Field Theory (EFT). This agreement of the theory
	with several hundred data points provides a non-trivial description
	of both nearside ("ridge") and away-side azimuthal collimations of
	long range rapidity correlations in p+p collisions. Our prediction
	in arXiv:1210.3890 for proton-lead (p+Pb) collisions is consistent
	with results from the recent CMS p+Pb run at $\sqrt{s}_{\rm NN} =
	5.02$ TeV for the largest track multiplicity $N_{\rm track}\sim 40$
	we considered. The CMS p+Pb data shows the following striking features:
	i) a strong dependence of the ridge yield on $N_{\rm track}$, with
	a significantly larger signal than in p+p for the same $N_{\rm track}$,
	ii) a stronger $p_T$ dependence than in p+p for large $N_{\rm track}$,
	and iii) a nearside collimation for large $N_{\rm track}$ comparable
	to the awayside for the lower $p_T = p_{T}^{\rm trig.}=p_{T}^{\rm
	assoc.}$ di-hadron windows. We show here that these systematic features
	of the CMS p+Pb di-hadron data are all described by the CGC (with
	parameters fixed by the p+p data) when we extend our prediction in
	arXiv:1210.3890 to rarer high multiplicity events. We also predict
	the azimuthally collimated yield for yet unpublished windows in the
	$p_{T}^{\rm trig.}$ and $p_{T}^{\rm assoc.}$ matrix.},

  abstract = {Correlation functions measured as a function of $\Delta \eta, \Delta
	\phi$ have emerged as a powerful tool to study the dynamics of particle
	production in nuclear collisions at high energy. They are however
	subject, like any other observables, to instrumental effects which
	must be properly accounted for to extract meaningful physics results.
	We compare the merits of several techniques used towards measurement
	of these correlation functions in nuclear collisions. We discuss
	and distinguish the effects of finite acceptance, and detection efficiency
	that may vary with collision parameters such as the position of the
	event in the detector and the instantaneous luminosity of the beam.
	We focus in particular on instrumental effects which break the factorization
	of the particle pair detection efficiency, and describe a technique
	to recover the robustness of correlation observables. We finally
	introduce a multi-dimensional weight method to correct for efficiencies
	that vary simultaneously with particle pseudo rapidity, azimuthal
	angle, transverse momentum, and the collision vertex position. The
	method can be generalized to account for any number of "event variables"
	that may break the factorability of the pair efficiency.},
